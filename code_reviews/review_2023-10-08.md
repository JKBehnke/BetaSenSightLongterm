## NOTES externalized_lfp.py
| Positives      | To improve |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Good code documentation       | Remove unused imports (and sort imports) - it slows down your code!       |
| Functions have precise names | Rule of thumb: Maximum 100 lines per function        |
| Type annotations in function arguments are great! | Also annotate return type of functions |
| Variable names adhere to PEP-8, awesome!! | Only use global variables if strictly necessary. Otherwise move to functions. |
| | If you have nested loops, consider making a loop into a function. | 
| | Handle all potential errors!! |
| | Set up auto formatting (black) |
