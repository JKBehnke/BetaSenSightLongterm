    Loading pickle files with psdAverage or (((Peak values))) from frequency bands alpha, beta, lowBeta and highBeta
    Ranking within each session channelGroup and formatting Dataframes to use in the Permutation function.


    Input:
        - result: str "psdAverage" or "peak" -> this decides what you want to rank 
        - filterSignal: str, "band-pass" or "unfiltered"
        - normalization: str, ""rawPsd", "normPsdToTotalSum", "normPsdToSum1_100Hz", "normPsdToSum40_90Hz"
        - freqBand: str, "alpha", "beta", "lowBeta", "highBeta"

    1) Load the BIPpeak or BIPpsdAverage Pickle file written with functions from BIP_channelGroups.py
        - one pickle file contains either the psdAverage or peak Values from 4 freqency bands: alpha, beta, lowBeta, highBeta

    2) edit all Dataframes from Ring, SegmIntra and SegmInter:
        - from Ring DF: drop irrelevant BIP channels 03, 02, 13 (not adjacent)
        - in all DF: add column "rank" with ranking of psdAverage or PEAK_5HzAverage
        - save new DF with rankings as pickle files in results folder
    
    3) create new version of Dataframes:
        - e.g. Dataframe each for Ring_postop, Ring_fu3m, Ring_fu12m, Ring_18m 
        - columns: session, bipolarChannel, freqBand, absoluteOrRelativePSD, averagedPSD, rank, subject_hemisphere

    

    TODO: does Permutation analysis work if I don't have same number of values within each group?
    Watch out !! doesn't work for peak files, somehow not all channels have a peak value, sometimes only 2 channels in one dataframe.... not sure why
